Catalog of every wiki page. Maintained by the vault operations (`/capture`,
`/sync`, `/lint`) — see `brain/CLAUDE.md`.

## Strategies

- [[ms-shift-spy]] — ms_shift on SPY/QQQ; displacement-filtered
  structure breaks; `retired` (failed backtest→paper gate, real 2016-2024
  data; see Lifecycle history for the fold-regime follow-up).
- [[ms-shift-spy-high-displacement]] — v2, single-variable follow-up
  raising the displacement threshold 1.5x→2.0x ATR; `retired` (Sharpe
  0.813, close on Sortino but still failed the gate — see Lifecycle
  history for the stop-loss-gap finding it points to next).

## Concepts

- [[market-structure-shift]] — decisive break of the prevailing swing
  sequence; core setup of the `ms_shift` family.
- [[displacement]] — wide-range confirmation of a break; the quality filter
  for structure shifts.
- [[stop-loss-rearm-coupling]] — why gating a stop's re-arm on the same
  rare event a trend-persistent signal uses to reverse can lock a position
  out of the exact recovery that would have vindicated it; the "Option C"
  fix and its OOS validation on ms-shift-spy-v1/v2.

## Postmortems

  ms-shift-spy-v1 (P9 template demonstration).
